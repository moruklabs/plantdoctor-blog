# Complete Indoor Plant Pest & Disease Management Guide

Every indoor gardener faces the same challenge: keeping plants healthy in an artificial environment where pests and diseases can thrive unchecked. Unlike outdoor gardens with natural predators and weather cycles that reset populations, indoor spaces create perfect conditions for infestations to explode overnight.

This comprehensive guide brings together proven strategies for identifying, treating, and preventing the most common indoor plant pests and diseases. You'll learn integrated pest management (IPM) protocols that work in real apartments and homes, quick triage systems for emergency situations, and prevention tactics that stop problems before they start.

Whether you're dealing with your first fungus gnat outbreak or managing a persistent spider mite problem, this guide provides the step-by-step protocols you need.

## Fungus Gnats: The Most Common Indoor Pest

Fungus gnats are the #1 pest complaint from indoor gardeners. These tiny flying insects don't harm plants directly, but their larvae feed on roots and organic matter in soil, weakening plants over time.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Early detection saves plants**: Weekly monitoring with quick triage protocols catches problems before they spread
2. **Fungus gnats are most common**: Most indoor gardeners will face them - BTI, H2O2, and DE all work with proper application
3. **Quarantine new plants**: 21-day isolation prevents introducing pests to your collection
4. **IPM beats pesticides**: Integrated approaches combining cultural, physical, and biological controls work better long-term
5. **Know when to use chemicals**: Some situations require fungicides or miticides - use them safely and strategically
6. **Prevention is cheapest**: Proper watering, humidity control, and plant spacing prevent most problems
7. **Document everything**: Photos help with diagnosis and tracking treatment effectiveness

## Next Steps

1. Start with a weekly monitoring routine
2. Set up a quarantine system for new plants
3. Choose your first action plan based on your current pest issue
4. Keep BTI, sticky traps, and neem oil on hand
5. Document with photos for future reference

Remember: Most pest and disease problems are manageable with early detection and consistent application of proven protocols. You don't need expensive equipment or harsh chemicals - just systematic observation and strategic intervention.

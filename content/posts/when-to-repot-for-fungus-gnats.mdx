# When to Repot for Fungus Gnats: Clear Decision Guide

I remember the first time I uprooted a beloved pothos only to find its soil crawling with tiny, wriggly larvae. My heart sank—then I took a breath and followed a clear decision process that saved the plant and stopped the infestation spreading to the rest of my collection. If you’re staring at a gnat problem, this guide gives you that same calm, practical pathway: exactly when repotting is the right move, when it’s risky, and how to do it safely when necessary.

Short version: follow diagnostic thresholds (larvae counts, root/crown checks), choose non-repotting controls when possible, and use a sterile repot protocol when infestation or rot is severe.

## Why this matters (short version)

Fungus gnats are more than a nuisance. Adults are mostly annoying, but larvae feed on organic matter and tender roots; heavy infestations can stunt or kill sensitive houseplants. Repotting can remove contaminated soil, but done poorly it can spread larvae, shock a weakened plant, or introduce pathogens. This guide gives simple diagnostic thresholds, a safe repotting protocol, practical alternatives, and printable decision aids so you can act with confidence.

## How to diagnose the problem (fast checks you can do now)

You don’t need a microscope—just a steady eye and a few simple tests.

### Visual clues

- Adults: tiny, mosquito-like flies near the soil surface or flying up when you water. They indicate presence but not necessarily severity.
- Larvae: about 1/8 inch, translucent white with black heads; they wriggle when disturbed in soil or in a water test.
- Soil surface: white fungal strands, persistent moisture, or a thin layer of decomposing organic matter.

### Quick water test (my favorite field test)

I use this every time: set the pot in a shallow tray and pour water slowly into the top until it runs out the drainage holes. Collect runoff for a minute—then tilt the pot so the topsoil is exposed and scoop a small sample into a clear jar of water. Shake gently. If you see little white larvae wriggling within 30 seconds, you’ve confirmed fungus gnat larvae.

### Root check: what to look for when you inspect roots

- Healthy roots: firm, white or cream, and well-branched.
- Damaged roots: thin, dark, slimy, or falling apart when touched. Sour or rotten odors indicate decay.
- Crown rot: mushy or discolored tissue at the stem base—this is an emergency sign.

Real test: gently pull the plant from its pot when possible. If roots slip away from the soil as a loose mat, that’s a major red flag.

## Diagnostic thresholds: when to repot, when to treat in place

I like thresholds because they remove emotion from the decision. Below are practical cutoffs I use with my plants.

### Repotting recommended (do this)

- Larvae count: more than 10 visible larvae in a spoon-sized sample from the top 1–2 inches of soil, or persistent larvae after repeated sticky trap counts.
- Root health: obvious root decay (black, slimy roots) affecting more than ~30% of the root ball.
- Crown rot: any sign of crown or stem base rot.
- Rapid decline: wilting, yellowing, stunted growth not explained by watering or light.

If any of the above are true, repotting and removing contaminated soil is the clearest path to recovery.

### Treat in place (don’t repot yet)

- Larvae count: fewer than 5 larvae in a spoon sample; only occasional adults on sticky traps.
- Roots: mostly healthy, minimal nibbling on root tips, no sliminess.
- Plant stability: plant is stable, actively growing, and not showing severe decline.

If these apply, try less invasive options—topdressing, soil drying, biological controls, and traps—before disrupting roots.

### When repotting is risky (avoid unless necessary)

- Sensitive species: most succulents, many orchids, and plants that suffer root shock.
- Heavily budded or flowering plants: repotting can trigger bud drop.
- Plants that require aggressive root disturbance to repot.

If your plant fits these descriptions and larvae counts are low, prioritize non-repotting controls.

## Alternatives to repotting that actually work (with specifics)

I often avoid repotting when possible. Here’s what I use instead, with practical application details.

- Sticky traps: Place yellow sticky cards at soil level to catch adults and monitor activity. Replace weekly until counts drop.
- Topdressing: Remove the top 1 inch of soil and replace with 1 inch of coarse sand, grit, or horticultural perlite. This crust discourages egg-laying and reduces larvae near the surface.
- Biological controls:
  - Beneficial nematodes (Steinernema feltiae): Apply as a soil drench when soil is moist. Rehydrate packets per supplier instructions and drench until runoff. Store nematodes refrigerated and apply when soil temperatures are roughly 50–90°F (10–32°C). Keep surface moist for 7–10 days after application.[^1]
  - Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti): Use Bti granules or concentrate as a pot drench per label. It targets larvae specifically and is safe for plants when used as directed; repeat at label intervals (often 7–14 days) until adult counts drop.[^2]
- Soil drying: Allow the top 1–2 inches to dry between waterings to break the lifecycle. Combine with reduced fertilization to slow fungal growth.
- Hydrogen peroxide drench: A diluted 3% H2O2 solution (1 part 3% H2O2 to 4 parts water ≈ 0.6% final) can kill surface larvae and disinfect. Use sparingly—limit to a single severe-use drench or occasional follow-ups (max 1–2 applications spaced 7–14 days). Stop if you see phytotoxicity.[^3]

## When repotting will help and why

Repotting removes infested, decomposed soil and lets you inspect and trim damaged roots. In cases of root or crown rot, cleanup and a sterile fresh medium can save a plant. Repotting also allows switching to a faster-draining mix that discourages future infestations.

## A safe repotting protocol (step-by-step)

I treat repots like a small surgical procedure: clean workspace, sterile tools, and quarantine afterward.

### Prep that matters

- Workspace: well-lit, ventilated area away from other plants. Lay a tarp or use a large tub to catch soil.
- Sterile tools: scrub pruners and scoops with hot soapy water, then wipe with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Wear gloves if you prefer.
- New pot and substrate: choose clean pots with drainage. If reusing a pot, scrub and soak in 1:9 bleach:water for 10 minutes, then rinse thoroughly. Use a fresh, well-draining potting mix.
- Quarantine spot: set aside an isolated bright area for at least 3–4 weeks after repotting.

### The repotting steps I follow

1. Water lightly 12–24 hours before repotting so roots are pliable, not saturated.
2. Gently remove the plant from the pot. If stuck, tip and squeeze the pot—avoid tearing roots.
3. Shake off old soil. Brush away soil until roots are visible. For severe infestations, rinse roots under lukewarm water to remove larvae and soil.
4. Inspect roots carefully. Trim soft, black, or mushy roots with sterile shears. Remove rotten crown tissue back to healthy tissue. Don’t be afraid to cut—rotted roots won’t recover.
5. If crown rot was present, consider a mild fungicidal dip (follow product directions) or a single diluted hydrogen peroxide rinse—used sparingly.
6. Refill new pot with a base of fresh mix, position the plant, and backfill so the crown sits at the previous level.
7. Lightly water to settle the mix, let drain thoroughly, and place in quarantine.
8. Don’t fertilize for 4–6 weeks; let the plant focus on root recovery.

### Post-repotting quarantine and monitoring

- Quarantine for 3–6 weeks depending on severity. Keep sticky traps and check adult counts weekly.
- If activity persists after two weeks, consider a second soil drench with Bti or nematodes per label directions.
- Maintain drier surface conditions to deter reinfestation.

## Personal anecdote

A few years ago I discovered a pothos I’d had for five years was suddenly limp. I pulled it from its pot and found the soil full of wriggling larvae and a mushy crown. It wasn’t pretty. I set up a tarp in the kitchen, sterilized my tools, and got to work. I removed about 40% of the root mass, rinsed the roots, and trimmed all rotten tissue. I repotted into a fast-draining mix, did a single Bti drench per label, and quarantined the plant for six weeks. New growth started in about six weeks and continued steadily after that. The neighbors’ plants stayed clean, too—I had sterilized the reused pot and kept everything isolated. That repot was time-consuming, but it saved a plant I would have otherwise lost.

## Micro‑moment

I lifted the pot and felt the root ball slip apart in my hands—that instant told me: this is beyond topdressing. It’s time to repot.

## Preventing future infestations after repotting

Repotting without habit changes often leads to reinfestation. Small adjustments help a lot:

- Avoid overwatering: only water when the top 1–2 inches are dry.
- Use fast-draining mixes where appropriate.
- Sterilize reused pots and tools every time.
- Keep a layer of inert topdressing (pumice, grit) on susceptible plants.
- Inspect soil before bringing new plants home; quarantine new plants for two weeks.

## Printable decision matrix (compact, copy-ready)

Decision matrix – Fungus gnats

Step A: Confirm infestation
- Adults: yes / no
- Larvae in water test: 0–2 / 3–10 / >10

Step B: Root and crown assessment
- Roots: Healthy / <30% damage / >30% damage
- Crown rot: absent / present

Decision rules
- If larvae >10 OR crown rot present OR root damage >30% -> Repot (follow protocol)
- If larvae 3–10 AND root damage <30% -> Consider repot if plant is declining; otherwise try topdressing + Bti
- If larvae 0–2 AND roots healthy -> Treat in place with sticky traps, soil drying, and beneficials

Risk modifiers
- Sensitive species or active bloom: avoid repotting unless thresholds are exceeded
- Multiple infected plants: quick repotting + quarantine recommended to stop spread

## Printable stepwise repotting checklist (copy-ready)

- Prepare workspace and quarantine area
- Sterilize tools, pot, and surfaces
- Gather fresh potting mix, pumice/perlite, and a clean pot
- Water plant lightly 12–24 hrs before repotting
- Remove plant, shake and rinse soil from roots
- Trim damaged roots and any rotten crown tissue
- Optional: dip crown in fungicide or diluted peroxide (one-time)
- Replant in fresh mix at original crown depth
- Water lightly and allow to drain thoroughly
- Place in quarantine; set sticky traps
- Monitor weekly; avoid fertilizing for 4–6 weeks
- If adults persist after 2 weeks, apply biological control per label

## Troubleshooting common scenarios

- I repotted and adults are still flying: Adults can emerge from eggs or pupae that weren’t removed. Place sticky traps, keep the surface dry, and consider a timed Bti or nematode application 7–10 days after repotting.[^2]
- The plant looks shocked and drops leaves: Common after repotting. Keep bright indirect light, stable temperatures, and avoid further disturbance.
- I reused the pot — now other plants have gnats: If the pot wasn’t sterilized, you may have spread the problem. Deep clean pots with bleach, monitor nearby plants, and treat soil with Bti if you suspect contamination.[^4]

## Final thoughts and encouragement

Repotting is time-consuming and can feel risky, but with clear thresholds and a clean protocol it often saves plants suffering significant root damage or heavy fungus gnat infestations. Many mild infestations respond well to topdressing, drying, and biologicals—especially for sensitive species.

Key rule of thumb: let larvae counts, root health, and crown condition guide you. When you repot, treat it like a controlled procedure—sterile tools, fresh medium, and quarantine—and you’ll reduce risk to other plants and give the infested plant its best chance.

If you want, tell me about one of your problem plants and I’ll walk through the decision matrix with you step by step.

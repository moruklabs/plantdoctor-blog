# Quick quarantine decision guide for houseplants

I still remember bringing home a perfect fiddle‑leaf fig that developed mealybugs within 48 hours. I quarantined it, inspected, and had to decide: treat, repot, or toss. Over years of trial and error I built a simple, reliable decision process you can use at your quarantine station. This guide lays out clear thresholds (larvae counts, eggs, root health), a stepwise repotting protocol, safe disposal steps, quantified personal metrics (time, cost, success rates), product examples with safe dilutions, and a printable decision matrix you can pin up.

---

## Why quarantine matters (and how long it should last)

- Quarantine protects your collection while you observe and intervene.
- My routine: minimum 2 weeks for low‑risk plants; 3–4 weeks if pests or root issues are suspected.
- Tip: if you see any sign of pests, extend quarantine and escalate treatment.

Why not immediate placement? Nursery conditions can hide pests and early root rot. Quarantine gives you time to spot slow‑developing problems without risking your other plants.

## A simple decision matrix (three actions)

At quarantine you have three choices: Repot, Treat in place, or Toss. Keep this laminated by your station.

- Repot: immediate root wash + soil replacement. Trigger: visible eggs, clusters, or >10 larvae; widespread crawling insects with honeydew; moderate-to-severe root rot.
- Treat in place: manual removal + foliar/soil treatments. Trigger: 1–9 scattered pests, isolated spots, or healthy roots with foliar damage.
- Toss (safe disposal): Trigger: >50% root mass lost after trimming, repeated treatment failures, confirmed dangerous pathogen, or cost/time better spent replacing.

Quick printable rule-of-thumb (text version below is PDF-ready):

- No visible pests, healthy roots: Quarantine 14 days. Monitor.
- 1–9 pests or isolated eggs: Treat in place; quarantine 14–21 days; recheck weekly.
- 10+ pests or clustered eggs, or soil larvae >10: Repot immediately; quarantine 21–28 days.
- Root rot: If <50% root loss after trimming → repot & monitor; if >50% → consider disposal.

## Measurable metrics from my practice

- Typical repot time: 30–90 minutes (small plant 30–45 min; large or delicate specimen 60–90+ min).
- Consumable costs (typical range): potting mix $8–20 per bag, replacement pot $5–30, one systemic product $12–40, biologicals $12–30.
- Success rates I’ve seen:
  - Low infestation (treat in place): ~85% salvage.
  - Moderate infestation (1–9 pests, targeted repotting/treatment): ~65–75% salvage.
  - Severe infestation (>10 pests or >50% root rot): ~20–40% salvage; repotting improves odds but often not high.

These numbers are from my 7+ years of hobbyist experience—use them as a practical reference, not a guarantee.

> Personal note: I’ve learned that the numbers don’t tell the whole story. The real win is reducing risk to other plants and building a predictable, calm routine. I keep a little every‑plant quarantine station kit: a magnifier, a small flashlight, a notebook, a timer, and a printed decision matrix. It sounds tiny, but it changes how you react when you spot webbing or a warning smell in the soil.

## Inspect like a pro (fast, systematic)

1. Look before you touch: webbing, cottony patches, sticky honeydew, tiny black flies, or pale stippling.
2. Check leaves (both surfaces), veins, leaf axils, stem junctions, and the soil surface.
3. If repotting or lifting, inspect roots: healthy roots are firm and white/cream; rotten roots are dark, slimy, and smell sour.

Keep a magnifying glass and small flashlight in your quarantine kit.

## Step-by-step repotting protocol (concise)

Tools and supplies:

- Clean pot with drainage (one size up)
- Sterile potting mix (species appropriate)
- Sterilized cutting tool (70% isopropyl for wiping blades)
- Disposable gloves, paper towels, trash bag
- Small brush (old toothbrush), spray bottle
- Optional: biologicals or systemic product

Repotting steps (follow in order):

1. Prepare workspace outdoors or near a sink; lay down a mat and open a trash bag.
2. Water lightly a day before if soil is very compacted; skip watering if soil is swampy.
3. Remove plant from pot gently; ease root ball out.
4. Inspect roots and smell for rot.
5. Trim damaged roots to healthy tissue with sterilized scissors.
6. Gently remove nursery soil; use a brush and running water to clear soil if larvae/eggs suspected.
7. If reusing the pot, soak it 10 minutes in a 1:9 bleach:water solution, then rinse thoroughly.
8. Put fresh sterile mix in new pot, position plant at original depth, fill, and water lightly.
9. Label with date and treatments; monitor in quarantine for 2–4 weeks.

Quick tip: Partial soil replacement and surface soil amendment can reduce pest load with less shock for foliar infestations and healthy roots.

## Treatment options with practical examples and safe dilutions

Match the treatment to pest type and severity. Always read and follow product labels.

- Manual: Alcohol swabs (70% isopropyl) on cotton to wipe mealybugs, scale, aphids.
- Soapy spray: Mix 1 tsp mild liquid dish soap per quart (approx. 0.5 tsp per cup) of water; spray foliage and rinse after a few hours if plant is sensitive. Test one leaf first.
- Neem/horticultural oil: Typical dilution 1–2 tsp neem or horticultural oil per quart of water (roughly 0.5–1 tbsp per gallon). Apply in evening or low light; do not use on drought‑stressed plants.
- Bti (for fungus gnat larvae): Use a labeled Bti product (example: Mosquito Bits or Gnatrol). Follow the label — many granular products are applied at roughly 1–2 tbsp per pot surface or per gallon of topsoil, or as directed for a soil drench; Gnatrol® liquid concentrate label instructions typically give a measured amount to mix per gallon for a drench. Always follow label instructions for concentration and frequency.
- Beneficial nematodes: Follow supplier instructions; keep soil moist and apply during cooler parts of day. Effective temperatures vary by species—read product guidance.
- Systemic insecticides: Useful for persistent sap-suckers; use sparingly indoors and follow label precautions for houseplants and household safety.

If you repotted for soil infestation, consider a one-time soil drench of a labeled product after root washing and monitor carefully.

## Safe disposal steps

When disposal is the right call, do it safely to avoid spreading pests.

1. Seal the plant and soil in heavy‑duty trash bags. Double-bag if necessary.
2. Do not compost infested material unless you have access to industrial composting that reaches pathogen‑killing temperatures.
3. If allowed, place sealed bags in municipal trash per local rules; optionally leave sealed bag shaded outdoors for a few days before disposal to reduce live pests.
4. Disinfect tools, pots, trays, and surfaces with 1:9 bleach:water or 70% isopropyl alcohol.

## Cost‑benefit lens (practical thresholds)

Use objective criteria so emotions don’t drive costly decisions:

- Low‑value plant + high infestation = toss.
- High‑value or sentimental plant + moderate infestation = invest in repotting and follow‑up treatments.
- Repeated failed treatments or high risk to other plants = prioritize collection safety and dispose.

A simple visual rule: low value + high infestation = toss; high value + moderate infestation = repot and treat.

## Real-life short case studies

Example 1 — Fungus gnats in a philodendron

- Signs: flying adults and larvae. Action: removed top 2" soil, replaced with fresh mix, applied Bti as a soil drench per product label, set sticky traps. Quarantine: 3 weeks. Outcome: success.

Example 2 — Mealybugs on a rare peperomia

- Signs: mealybugs and eggs in leaf axils. Action: full repot, root wash, remove infected leaves, alcohol swabs on pests, targeted systemic once. Quarantine and weekly checks. Outcome: recovered after ~1 month.

Example 3 — Root rot on a cheap fern

- Signs: waterlogged crown, >60% roots rotten. Action: trimmed and repotted; plant declined. Outcome: disposed safely. Lesson: factor plant value into rescue effort.

## Printable decision matrix (copy, laminate, pin)

You can copy this block to a single page for printing:

Decision Matrix (printable)

- No visible pests, healthy roots: Quarantine 14 days. Monitor weekly.
- 1–9 pests or isolated eggs: Treat in place (manual removal + soapy spray or neem). Quarantine 14–21 days. Reassess.
- 10+ pests, clustered eggs, or soil larvae >10: Repot immediately, wash roots, replace soil, apply Bti or labeled soil drench. Quarantine 21–28 days.
- Root rot signs: Inspect roots. If <50% root loss → trim & repot; if >50% → consider disposal.
- Repeated treatment failures or high infestation on low‑value plant: Dispose safely (double‑bag, do not compost).

---

## Practical quarantine station checklist (compact)

- Isolated shelf or tray area
- Sticky traps, magnifier, flashlight
- Spray bottle with soapy mix and plain water
- Gloves, alcohol wipes, small scissors/sterilized shears
- Notebook or photo log (date treatments, observations)

---

## Final workflow (short)

1. Inspect objectively.
2. Apply decision matrix.
3. Act decisively: repot, treat, or dispose.
4. Record actions and monitor in quarantine for 2–4 weeks.

Decisive, early action protects the rest of your collection and raises your odds of salvage. If you want, I can format the printable matrix into a PDF‑ready one‑page layout and provide a downloadable file—tell me the paper size (A4 or US Letter) and I'll draft it.

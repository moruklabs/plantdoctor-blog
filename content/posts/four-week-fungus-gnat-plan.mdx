# Four-Week Eradication Plan for Fungus Gnats Indoors

## Introduction

I remember the first time I saw them: tiny, delicate flies hovering over my favorite pothos like paper lanterns. At first I shrugged—just annoying, I thought. Then new leaves began to wilt and a couple of translucent larvae wriggled in the topsoil. Over several weekends I tested matchbox tricks, store-bought sprays, and the odd folklore remedy until I mapped a reliable week-by-week timeline that actually works.

That story is why I wrote this guide: to turn trial-and-error into a short, repeatable calendar. I’ll walk you through what’s happening in the soil, what to do each week, and exactly how to dose BTI (Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis), handle entomopathogenic nematodes, and decide when repotting is the fastest solution. The plan is practical and conservative—no extreme chemicals, and clear cues for when to escalate.

> Micro-moment: One morning I counted 27 gnats on a single sticky trap. Ten days into the plan, that same trap held one sad, lonely fly. The sight felt like a small victory.

## Quick overview: Why timing matters

Fungus gnats (small flies in the family Sciaridae and related groups) have a short, predictable life cycle: eggs, larvae feeding in soil, pupae, and short-lived adults. Adults live about a week; larvae feed for 2–3 weeks. Hitting the vulnerable stages—especially larvae in the soil—makes eradication much faster than only trapping adults.

Treating adults without addressing the larvae is like patching a roof while a leak runs—temporary relief, likely comeback.

"Treating the right life stage at the right time is the difference between a two-week fix and a month of frustration."

## The life cycle, in plain language

Fungus gnats typically complete their life cycle in 3–4 weeks indoors under warm, moist conditions.

- Egg: Laid in the top 1–2 inches of moist soil; hatch in 3–6 days.
- Larva: Small, translucent, legless worms with dark heads; feed on organic matter and tender roots for 2–3 weeks.
- Pupa: Immobile in soil for 3–7 days.
- Adult: Small, mosquito-like flies that live 5–7 days, mate, and lay eggs.

Those windows let you schedule actions that stop reproduction and destroy the next generation.

## How to use this guide

Start the timeline the day you first notice adults or larvae. If you only see adults, begin at Week 0; if you find many larvae or root damage, treat as if you’re in Week 1 or 2 and consider the severe protocol sooner.

Print the monitoring log and record daily sticky-trap counts for the first week, then weekly after that. I include concrete dosing steps (Mosquito Bits steeping, BTI application, nematode storage) so you can replicate what worked for me.

## Week-by-week eradication timeline

### Week 0 — Immediate triage (first 48–72 hours)

What’s happening: Adults are flying, mating, and laying eggs. If you see adults, eggs are likely already in the soil.

Fastest actions:

- Place yellow sticky traps at canopy level, close to soil. Count daily to build a baseline.
- Stop all top watering. Let the top 1–2 inches dry to slow egg hatching and larval survival.
- Move small or vulnerable plants away from others to limit spread.

Why these work: Traps remove reproducing adults and drying the surface interrupts moisture-dependent development.

Expected decline metrics: With moisture reduction and traps, many growers see a noticeable drop in adults within 72 hours.

### Week 1 — Target larvae with BTI and monitor

What’s happening: Eggs hatch and early-stage larvae are vulnerable.

Fastest actions:

- Apply BTI (Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis). Consumer forms include Mosquito Bits, Mosquito Dunks, or labeled liquid BTI products.

How to steep Mosquito Bits (practical steps):

- Use 1 tablespoon Mosquito Bits per 1 cup (240 ml) warm water. Stir and let sit 15–30 minutes, then strain the liquid (discard solids) and water plants with that solution until the root zone is moist. Increase proportionally for larger pots.
- Alternatively, follow the product label for dunk or liquid-dilution rates.

Dosing guidance and notes:

- Deliver BTI into moist soil where larvae feed. Water to the root zone but allow the top inch to dry between waterings.
- Apply weekly while larvae are present (see Week 2/3).

- Continue using sticky traps and record daily catches.

Why BTI: BTI produces toxins targeting dipteran larvae and is considered low risk to people, pets, and many beneficials when used as directed[^1][^2].

Expected decline metrics: Properly applied BTI often leads to substantial larval reductions within 3–7 days and fewer new adults by the end of Week 1.

Personal anecdote (expanded): On a crowded shelf with ten mixed houseplants I counted about 25 adults per day on traps before treatment. I stopped top-watering, put sticky traps at pot level, and used a Mosquito Bits steeped drench (1 tbsp/240 ml as above) across the shelf. By Day 4 counts fell to eight per day (roughly a 68% drop) and by Day 10 they were down to one or two daily. New growth resumed its usual firmness inside three weeks. That hands-on run helped me refine the dosing and the simple habit of labeling my dilution jars—small practices that made follow-ups faster and less error-prone.

### Week 2 — Reinforce and consider aggressive options for heavy infestations

What’s happening: Remaining larvae may be later instars or pupating. New adults from untreated larvae could emerge.

Fastest actions:

- Reapply BTI weekly until no larvae are detected.
- Add a 1/4–1/2 inch top-dressing of coarse sand or decorative lava rock to discourage egg-laying on the soil surface.

When to repot: quick checklist

- Visible larvae in the top 1–2 inches.
- Root damage or slow, yellowing new growth.
- Sticky traps show sustained counts after two BTI rounds.

If repotting:

- Use a sterile, fast-draining potting mix (avoid heavy composts). Remove old soil from the root ball; gently rinse and trim rotten roots.
- Apply a BTI drench at repotting and settle the plant in a clean container.

Why repotting helps: When soil is heavily infested, removing that reservoir is often the fastest route to control.

Expected decline metrics: With weekly BTI and a surface barrier most people see adult trap counts drop substantially by the end of Week 2; repotted plants often clear within a week.

### Week 3 — Clean up pupae and mop up survivors

What’s happening: Pupae are finishing development; surviving larvae may produce a final cohort of adults.

Fastest actions:

- Maintain sticky traps and continue weekly BTI if larvae remain.
- Consider Steinernema feltiae (entomopathogenic nematodes) for larvae that BTI may not reach. Apply per label and keep soil moist for 48–72 hours to aid nematode movement.

Nematode handling and storage:

- Store nematodes refrigerated (about 2–7°C / 35–45°F) and use by the expiration date. Do not freeze or expose to high heat. Apply in the evening or on cool/cloudy days and keep soil slightly moist after application.

- Chemical options: consider only labeled soil drenches for indoor use and follow label safety (spinosad can be used in some larval drenches; check restrictions). Use the lowest effective rate and prioritize safety.

Why nematodes: Steinernema species actively seek and infect larvae, which helps in complex pots where drenches might not fully contact every larva[^4].

Expected decline metrics: Integrated measures often reduce adult catches to near zero by the end of Week 3 in well-managed situations.

### Week 4 — Verification and prevention

What’s happening: Final generation is winding down. Remaining populations should be negligible if you’ve followed the plan.

Fastest actions:

- Continue monitoring with sticky traps for 1–2 more weeks. Replace traps weekly.
- Resume careful watering: allow the top inch to dry; use bottom-watering for moisture-loving plants to maintain a drier surface.
- Keep top-dressing and use sterile mixes for future repotting.

Why monitoring matters: Gnats can reappear if new breeding sites emerge—overwatering, fresh organic-rich mixes, or standing water in saucers can restart the cycle.

Expected decline metrics: If trap counts were near zero in Week 3, Week 4 should confirm recovery. A few stragglers don’t always mean a rebound—if counts rise, revisit the severe protocol.

## Severe infestation protocol (fastest route to recovery)

If you have dozens of adults, many larvae visible in soil, and obvious root damage, use this aggressive plan:

1. Remove the plant and gently shake or rinse soil from roots. Trim rotten roots; keep healthy tissue.
2. Repot in sterile, fast-draining mix; add perlite or horticultural charcoal.
3. Apply a BTI drench at repotting and follow up with Steinernema feltiae as a secondary measure (store and apply nematodes as noted).
4. Use sticky traps and keep pots on well-draining trays to avoid pooled water.

This clears the soil reservoir while treating remaining larvae and reducing future breeding grounds.

## Monitoring log (printable)

Below is a clean Markdown table you can print or copy into a spreadsheet.

| Week | Sticky trap count (total) | Visible larvae? (Y/N) | BTI applied (Y/N) | Repotted (Y/N) | Notes |
| ---: | :-----------------------: | :-------------------: | :---------------: | :------------: | :---- |
|    0 |                           |                       |                   |                |       |
|    1 |                           |                       |                   |                |       |
|    2 |                           |                       |                   |                |       |
|    3 |                           |                       |                   |                |       |
|    4 |                           |                       |                   |                |       |

Tip: Take weekly photos so you can visually compare adult counts and new growth.

## Signs you’re winning (and not winning)

You’re likely winning if:

- Sticky trap counts drop steadily.
- Fewer or no larvae in the top 1–2 inches of soil.
- New leaves are firm and not yellowing from root feeding.

You’re not winning if:

- Adult counts stay steady or increase after two BTI applications.
- Many larvae and root damage persist.
- You catch adults but never find larvae—this suggests a nearby plant or external source.

If you’re not winning, move to the severe protocol. Repotting often changes the game quickly.

## Frequently asked timing questions

Q: How long until fungus gnats are gone completely?
A: For treated plants, near-complete control is usually seen in 3–4 weeks. Whole-house clearance depends on untreated plants and other breeding habitats.

Q: How often should I apply BTI?
A: Weekly until no larvae are found and sticky trap counts remain near zero for two consecutive weeks.

Q: Can sticky traps alone work?
A: Traps reduce adults but won’t eliminate larvae. Use traps as one part of an integrated plan.

## A few practical notes from experience

- Don’t overdo the dry-surface trick on moisture-loving plants (some aroids). I use bottom-watering for those and let the top inch dry.
- Mosquito Bits steeped into a liquid drench is cost-effective and easy—I keep a small labeled jar of dilution in the fridge for up to a week.
- When repotting, remove clearly rotten tissue but avoid over-pruning healthy roots that can shock the plant.
- Nematodes are living—store cool and apply when you can keep soil slightly moist; they’re sensitive to heat and dryness.

## Preventing a rebound

Prevention is easier than cure:

- Water deliberately: let the top inch dry and avoid standing water in saucers.
- Use well-draining, lower-organic potting mixes. Peat-rich, compost-heavy mixes attract gnats.
- Clean trays and remove decomposing material from soil surfaces.
- Quarantine new plants for 2–3 weeks and inspect soil for adults or larvae.

## Final thoughts

Fungus gnats hide beneath the surface, but their predictable life cycle is an advantage: it gives you a calendar to attack vulnerable stages. Trap adults immediately, kill larvae with BTI, and use biologicals or repotting for stubborn infestations.

Follow the week-by-week plan, track progress with the monitoring log, and you’ll likely be finished in a month. In my experience across different plant types, this approach reliably converts stress into control.

Good luck—and enjoy your pest-free plants.

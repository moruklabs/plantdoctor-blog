## 🚀 What's Next

**Choose Next Phase:**

**Option A: Phase 6 - Implement Themes**

- Apply 4 theme variants across all components
- Replace hardcoded colors with theme variables
- Test theme switching on all pages
- Fix mixed styling approach (current blocker)
- Estimate: 2-3 days

**Option B: Phase 7 - Internationalization**

- Implement next-intl for 5+ languages
- Add language selector component
- Translate content structure
- Set up locale routing
- Estimate: 3-4 days

**Recommendation:** Start with Phase 6 (Theme Implementation) since:

- Theme architecture is already in place
- Fixes high-priority issue #5 (mixed styling)
- Smaller scope, faster completion
- Better foundation before i18n work

**Branch Strategy:**

- Current: `refactor/phase-5-theme-architecture` (clean, all work committed)
- Next: Create `refactor/phase-6-implement-themes` OR `refactor/phase-7-internationalization`

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Blockers

> **🚨 COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS COMPLETED (2025-11-16)**
>
> Full codebase audit revealed **33 issues** (2 Critical, 6 High, 19 Medium, 6 Low).
> See **ANTI-PATTERNS.md** for complete report and **ADR-008** in DECISIONS.md for analysis decision.

### Critical Blockers (MUST FIX BEFORE DEPLOYMENT)

1. **Build-blocking TypeScript compilation error**
   - File: `tests/e2e/lighthouse-theme-audit.spec.ts:13`
   - Error: Module '@axe-core/playwright' has no exported member 'playAudit'
   - Fix: Change to default import
   - Estimate: 5 min
   - **Status:** 🔴 BLOCKS BUILD

2. **TypeScript strict mode disabled**
   - File: `tsconfig.json:7`
   - Impact: Type safety gaps, allows unsafe patterns, implicit `any` types
   - Fix: Enable incrementally, fix errors file-by-file
   - Estimate: 4-6 hours
   - **Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL

### High Priority Issues (FIX BEFORE RELEASE)

3. **Massive CSS duplication (210 lines)**
   - Files: `app/layout.tsx` (lines 72-212) + `app/globals.css`
   - Impact: Maintenance nightmare, breaks single source of truth
   - Fix: Remove inline `<style>` block, use only globals.css
   - Estimate: 1 hour

4. **`any` types in production code**
   - Files: `mdx-components.tsx`, `structured-data-script.tsx`, `feature-toggles.ts`
   - Impact: Type safety bypassed in 4+ files
   - Fix: Replace with proper types (MDXComponents, JsonLd)
   - Estimate: 2 hours

5. **Mixed styling approach (breaks theming)**
   - File: `components/atoms/badge.tsx:74-82`
   - Impact: Hardcoded colors won't theme, inconsistent dark mode
   - Fix: Standardize to semantic CSS variables
   - Estimate: 1 hour

6. **Image optimization disabled**
   - File: `next.config.mjs:20` (unoptimized: true)
   - Impact: Lighthouse Performance score reduced, larger bundles
   - Fix: Enable for non-static builds
   - Estimate: 30 min

7. **100+ placeholder values not replaced**
   - Files: `lib/config.ts`, `layout.tsx`, `header.tsx`, `footer.tsx`, 50+ content
   - Impact: App not production-ready, damaged SEO
   - Fix: Replace all `[[REPLACE_ME_*]]` placeholders
   - Estimate: 3-4 hours

8. **Very low component test coverage (4% vs 80% target)**
   - Stats: 26 components, only 1 test (badge.test.tsx)
   - Missing: Header, Footer, ThemeToggle, Navigation, BlogPostContent
   - Fix: Create component tests for all organisms
   - Estimate: 8-10 hours

### Medium Priority (19 issues)

See **ANTI-PATTERNS.md** for complete list. Top items:

- Dead/unused components (email-cta-button, featured-post, recent-posts-grid)
- Atomic Design violations (ui/ directory outside hierarchy)
- Inconsistent component exports (default vs named)
- Hardcoded guide titles in footer
- TODO comments in critical code
- Fragile static export configuration

### Low Priority (6 issues)

See **ANTI-PATTERNS.md** sections 19-21 for polish items.

---

**Previously Tracked Issues:**

9. **ThemeProvider not integrated** - Exists in codebase but not wired in layout.tsx
   - Priority: P1 (must fix in Phase 5)
   - File: `app/layout.tsx`
   - Impact: Theme system exists but non-functional

10. **No internationalization** - Single language only

- Priority: P1 (Phase 7)

11. **Dating-specific content throughout** - Not yet genericized

- Priority: P2 (address progressively during phases 5-12)

**Current Blockers:** 🔴 2 CRITICAL ISSUES (see items #1-2 above)
